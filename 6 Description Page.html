          <b> Black women physicians’ stories have gone untold for far too long, leaving gaping holes in American
              medical history, in women’s history, and in black history. It’s time to set the record straight. </b> 
        </p>

        <p>  No real account of black women physicians in the US exists, and what little
          mention is made of these women in existing histories is often insubstantial or
          altogether incorrect. In this work of extensive research, Jasmine Brown offers a
          rich new perspective, penning the long-erased stories of nine pioneering black
          women physicians beginning in 1860, when a black woman first entered
          medical school. Brown champions these black women physicians, including 
          stories of:
        </p>

         <b> Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler</b>, who graduated from medical school only fourteen
          months after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed and provided medical
          care for the newly freed slaves who had been neglected and exploited 
          by the medical system and many more.
